          //STEP 1: XMLH ttpRequest();
          //STEP 2: (Call on the AJAX Open();)
          //STEP 3: Define the AJAX Callback
          //STEP 4: Call on the AJAC Send();

            //STEP 1:setup the xml http request object (instantiate AJAX Object) (has a basic syntax)
            var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest(); //set up variable. a new instanmce,  
            //making a new XMLHttpRequest object that instructs the browser that we're going to be dealing with ajax
            //and pass that with the name of ajax, we now just reference ajax instead of XMLHttpRequest
            
            //STEP 2: (a Built in method) prepare the open ajax request 

            //requires two parameters. when dealing with browsers and dealing with web servers, will be using GET or POST method

            //step up an open method, when useing the open method you have to use http method of sending information to the server
            //instructions on how to handle the data, based on web browsert, the get or opost metho going to define
            ajax.open('GET', 'content.html'); //use AJAX open method (Get method, 'address' where we're sending the data, the information we're going to get)
             
            //GET recieve info from server (sends info out in the open, security isn't something will have) 
            //POST to send info to the server (when want to send  secure info to server, as it sends its info seperately from URL)

            //STEP 3: define the ajax response callback method

            //block of code, broswers has instructions on what to do when it receives the information, response back from the server 
            //different modes, different ready state changes that its watching for
            //when its not doing anything, in its ready stage, state might be 2 or 3, has values, when infor gets successful sent, 
            //server has parsed and sent back as a response, now waiting for us to do something with it, its a ready state of 4
            
            ajax.onreadystatechange = function() { //call ajax, calls its a onreadystatechange, setup a function
                if (ajax.readyState == 4) { //only want to watch for IF the server has succesful sent information back to us, the ready state = 4, 
                  //if its got errors messages, if its not quite got the ino back to use we don't want this block of code to fire off, only succuessful
                    document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = ajax.responseText; //,using some vanilla JS, property response text, will place in div tag
                    //going to get infor from server, requesting data from content
                }
            }
              //haven't sent the request yet
              //need to define trigger or event DOM will be watching for
              //eg on button click

            //STEP 4 send the ajax request for data
            function getContent() {
                ajax.send(); //using send method, no parameters to put in (don't have anything to send infor, just requesting)
                document.getElementById('btn_content').style.display='none'; //affecting the 'style' will 'hide' button
